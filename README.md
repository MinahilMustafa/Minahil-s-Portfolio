# Minahil-s-Portfolio
This responsive portfolio showcases my evolution as a Computer Science student using semantic HTML5, modular CSS3, and interactive JavaScript. Designed with a soothing site features six key sections: Home, About, Education, Experience, Skills, and Projects â€“ all connected through an animated navigation system with active state indicators.
